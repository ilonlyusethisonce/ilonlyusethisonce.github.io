        For our final project in Technology, we created a website which was a digital portfolio of our acomplishments in Tech. To start, we learned HTML and CSS using StudioWeb, and later, a course on Khan Academy. Once we had completed the courses, we used a program called Brackets to create our website, which consisted of descriptions of our projects in Tech. Afterward, we published our website using Github.

        We built and programmed VEX Robots to control and eventually use in a competition. We started by assembling our robots in groups, and then changed groups to program the robots. We used the coding language RobotC to code the robots. Some of the things we coded for the robots to code were to home itself to the start after pressing the button 8 Up, or to pick up a ball when 7 Up is pressed. We then had a a competition, where the robots had to pick up balls and place them in a bin or on the opponent's side.
